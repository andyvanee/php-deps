php-deps
========

Pear and source PHP dependencies for to install using composer.

These are all copies of legacy software from Pear and elsewhere,
packaged here for a clean front-end composer.json file, and because
pear.net is painfully slow to index for each update.

Packages all have the php-deps vendor prefix and the zip/tar files
are in the github downloads area.
